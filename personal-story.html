        <p>I know it's cliché, but my story began as a young child growing up in the United Kingdom to two immigrant parents, Andrea from Brazil and Magnus from Sweden. Seeing them as entrepreneurs, it inspired me to be outgoing and always work my best.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Despite having two entrepreneurial parents, my mother Andrea was certainly my biggest inspiration as she was a marketing-whiz. I grew up watching her navigate and learning from what she would tell me about sales, CRM and maintaining a brand image.</p>

        <p>Growing up alongside the rise of technology, the internet felt like a playground with endless potential. Looking back, I realise I was picking up real business acumen without even knowing it. In social video games, I found myself building mini-businesses based on user-generated content and digital currencies. One example: I created 3D models and scripted a game where users could customise avatars and buy clothing I had designed, inspired by trending looks on social media. That project still generates passive income today.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I also worked in games like Roblox, where entire companies operated virtually with departments like HR, Operations, Finance, and Marketing. At just nine years old, I climbed those virtual corporate ladders, often hiding my age behind strong grammar, a curious mind, and technical know-how I picked up by observing older peers. I was using platforms like Trello, scripting in Luau, and managing community servers on Discord before I even hit double digits.</p>

        <p>During COVID-19, I started to realise that marketing might be my thing. I decided to experiment with influencing, diving deep into the Instagram algorithm by analysing post performance and engagement trends. Over time, I figured out what worked, consistently hitting over a million views per post. That opened the door to brand partnerships, with companies like Nerf reaching out, and I was eventually able to charge over £10,000 per post.</p>
        <br>
        <p>As my account started gaining traction and I began getting recognised publicly in the UK, my high school stepped in. They ordered me to delete the account and wait until after graduation before having a public profile.</p>

        <p>After graduating high school, I was quickly signed by a talent agency and started working professionally in commercial modelling, theatre, and film. I had the chance to collaborate with exciting brands like GoHenry, A Bathing Ape, and Cornelsen, and began building a name for myself in the industry.</p>
        <br>
        <p>While I enjoyed being in front of the camera, marketing was always in the back of my mind. I loved performing, but I found myself even more curious about what my agents were doing behind the scenes: how they positioned talent, secured deals, and built brand strategies. That's what really stuck with me.</p>

      <div class="story-text">
        <p>Since then, I've worked professionally across PR firms, in-house marketing teams, and as a freelance journalist. I've had the chance to gain international experience through projects based in the UK, US, France, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, Denmark, Norway, and Portugal. With each role, I've been focused on developing my craft and learning from every opportunity.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I've worked as an intern, coordinator, and manager, and feel just as comfortable leading a project as I do collaborating within a team. I'm always thinking about campaigns and ways to make things better; chances are, if you name a brand, I've probably already come up with an idea for it.</p>
